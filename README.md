Noclip script for RedM, with two control modes:

- Absolute, where movement is based on the cardinal directions:
  - W = North
  - S = South
  - A = East
  - D = West

- Relative, where movement is based on the current heading:
  - W = Forward
  - S = Backward
  - A = Rotate left
  - D = Rotate right
